1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Conan O'Brien needs a fan.

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,460
Wanna talk to Conan?

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,560
Okay, let's get started.

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,040
Please.

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:15,860
Yes.

7
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:16,700
Hey.

8
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:17,540
Hi, Tom, welcome to Conan O'Brien.

9
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:18,360
Hello.

10
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,560
He needs a fan, nice sweater.

11
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,100
Wow. Thank you.

12
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,220
Good job.

13
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:26,440
First of all, Gourley on just being so positive so quickly.

14
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,200
Tom, so nice to see you.

15
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,040
I see you have your-

16
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:30,880
You too.

17
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,280
Your Christmas tree in the background.

18
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,040
It looks dark where you are.

19
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,760
We're in Los Angeles, where are you?

20
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,640
I'm Conan from Dublin, Ireland.

21
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,240
Oh, you're in Dublin.

22
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,320
Look at that fine Irish cable knit

23
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,320
fisherman sweater and Christmas tree.

24
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,800
I didn't live in the light.

25
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,000
I just wanna trade places with you.

26
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,400
I'm sorry, Mr. Gourley is making this sound

27
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,000
like the home shopping network.

28
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,760
Tom here is wearing a fine cable net sweater.

29
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,600
It's gorgeous.

30
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,800
It's made of a fine Dublin weave.

31
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,520
Sir, tell us, and Tom, what's your last name?

32
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,360
Lawler.

33
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,800
Okay, Tom Lawler, calling from or calling,

34
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,960
I guess zooming in, calling, whatever you wanna say.

35
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,280
Appearing to us magically from Dublin.

36
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,280
I love Dublin.

37
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,400
I love the few times I've visited there.

38
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,200
I've had a fantastic time.

39
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,520
Yeah, you've been a few times.

40
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,000
I've been a few times.

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,360
One of the times I went, I met up with a bunch of other,

42
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,960
well, very famous Irish comedians from Ireland

43
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,920
who were all hilarious, and we all did a show together

44
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,880
at the Ambassador's residence in Phoenix Park,

45
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,800
and I thought these are the funniest people I've ever met,

46
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,920
and then all of us got into a cab

47
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,200
to go into Dublin to get a drink,

48
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,400
and the cabbie was funnier than all of us,

49
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,360
and I thought that's Dublin.

50
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,240
There's just everyone that's just super high

51
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,960
professional level funny.

52
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,920
So no pressure on me then for the rest of this interview.

53
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,760
Well done.

54
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,920
Well, we can always say later on that you're,

55
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,760
you know, you're going through a depressive period,

56
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,320
you know, and so that gets you off the hook.

57
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,440
Tom, tell me a little bit about yourself.

58
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,400
Well, so I live in Dublin, as you know,

59
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,640
and I right now am the co-director of a festival

60
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,000
here in Dublin that the city started a number of years ago

61
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,640
called Bram Stoker Festival,

62
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,640
which is basically a way of us celebrating

63
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,680
the life and legacy and work of Bram Stoker,

64
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,800
who wrote Dracula.

65
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,120
Yep, and so this is interesting to me

66
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,840
because I don't have to say, I admit,

67
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,560
I don't know much about Bram Stoker, obviously.

68
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,680
His work is very famous,

69
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,480
but I don't know much about the man himself.

70
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,600
Was he Irish?

71
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,920
Yeah, he was Irish, and I think part of that,

72
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,120
one of the big reasons the festival was started

73
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,920
was I guess to kind of reclaim him as an Irish author, right?

74
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,600
So everybody knows Joyce and Beckett as Irish authors,

75
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,760
but I think a lot of people had kind of assumed

76
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,560
or thought that Bram Stoker was British,

77
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,480
and the Brits have a long history of claiming Irish people

78
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,200
as their own when they become very successful,

79
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,160
so it was kind of a way of taking it back

80
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:08,160
and kind of reclaiming him as a Dublin-born Irish writer, yeah.

81
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,040
That's actually very, I mean, that's fascinating to me.

82
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,920
You may have heard me say, I've said it many times,

83
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,160
because it's kind of fascinating slash sad to me,

84
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,560
but my people emigrated from Ireland

85
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,720
in the late 19th century,

86
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,680
and we've been living in central Massachusetts,

87
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,400
and I'm still genetically 100% Irish,

88
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,320
which is I think tragic.

89
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,920
Tom, will you please reclaim him?

90
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,760
Yeah.

91
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,580
Wait.

92
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:39,580
And Americans desperately want me to be reclaimed,

93
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,080
and they mean taken back to Ireland and kept there.

94
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,920
Well, we'd be delighted to reclaim you

95
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,880
and have you at the festival anytime, or in Dublin.

96
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,240
I mean, you're hugely popular.

97
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,360
I feel like lots of the friends or the fans

98
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,160
on this podcast are coming from Ireland as well, right?

99
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,000
You've got to go there.

100
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,760
No, it's funny, we do have,

101
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:59,760
I do get recognition from Irish people for the TV show,

102
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,000
but also a lot from the podcast, which is very nice.

103
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,480
So I'd love to go back there,

104
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,600
and I'd love to reconnect,

105
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,080
because I think it would be lovely.

106
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,140
That's a word that I hear a lot.

107
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:15,980
Lovely.

108
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,860
I've heard that in Ireland, they say,

109
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,260
isn't that lovely?

110
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,420
Also, they say, correct me if I'm wrong, Tom,

111
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,580
in America, people say um.

112
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:28,820
So if you ask me a question, I say, um, yeah.

113
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,620
I live near the Volkswagen dealership,

114
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,020
but about two blocks away.

115
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,860
The people I've met in Dublin say M, E, M.

116
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:36,940
Yeah, Gretan Norton.

117
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,180
Yeah, have you noticed that?

118
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,980
Yeah, actually, yeah, it's funny you say that,

119
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,100
because um.

120
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:41,940
M. M.

121
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:42,780
It just happened.

122
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,620
M.

123
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,220
When I moved to the States for college,

124
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,580
and I remember that was one of the first things

125
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,660
people pointed out when I lived there.

126
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:50,860
I went to college in Pennsylvania,

127
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,540
and one of the first things people noticed was,

128
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,300
why do you say M all the time?

129
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,140
We don't realize it, but yeah,

130
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,900
but that's one of the differences we have, I guess.

131
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,820
When I was in New York, I had a therapist,

132
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:06,820
a very brilliant woman who was from Dublin,

133
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,300
and she used to, I'd tell her about

134
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,300
whatever was going on in my life, and she'd say,

135
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,380
M, I think you're crazy.

136
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,220
You know.

137
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,140
That was her official diagnosis.

138
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:21,700
Her official diagnosis was that my family was shite,

139
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,820
and that I'm crazy.

140
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,900
So this is interesting, so you're trying to,

141
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:30,780
is there anyone else who we don't know is really Irish,

142
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,420
or can we start claiming people who aren't Irish,

143
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,540
but just claim them anyway, you know?

144
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,580
Like Daniel Craig, let's just start saying,

145
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:40,300
did you know he's from Dublin, even though he's not?

146
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,420
We should start grabbing cool people and saying they're Irish.

147
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,420
Absolutely, I mean, look, if you've got a list of people

148
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,820
you want me to start claiming as Irish,

149
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,580
we can put a festival together about all of them,

150
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,820
if the need to be, that's fine.

151
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,260
Yeah, Messi, Messi's from Dublin.

152
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,740
Lionel Messi's a true son of Ireland,

153
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,780
and then he was stolen!

154
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,660
He was stolen and taken away to Argentina.

155
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,980
We should just, because there are no better liars

156
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:07,460
in the world and confabulous than the Irish,

157
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,700
so we should just start making a list.

158
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,820
Batman, Batman's from, Uncle Sam!

159
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:13,660
Famous, the Irish.

160
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,660
No one thinks of Uncle Sam anymore.

161
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:21,060
What are you talking, no one thought of Uncle Sam

162
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,300
since like 1911.

163
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,620
I was trying to think of the most American icon possible.

164
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,620
No, no, no, I mean like Beyonce,

165
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,860
did you know that she's from Dublin?

166
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,460
Did you know that she's from Galway?

167
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,940
Yeah, it's Beyonce McNoles.

168
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:35,780
Yeah.

169
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,620
Wow.

170
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,060
I'm telling you, I think, Tom,

171
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,460
I think we're really onto something.

172
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,100
Sure, Bram Stoker, let's do that,

173
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,260
but I think you're missing a real opportunity here,

174
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,260
and I will help you generate the list.

175
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:51,380
We're gonna come up with just all of the coolest people.

176
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:54,060
And Keanu Reeves.

177
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,540
Keanu Reeves is from the...

178
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,260
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

179
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,580
He's from the South Country down there.

180
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,780
He's from Cork.

181
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,900
I don't know, we could, who's to stop us?

182
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,460
No one can stop us.

183
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,300
I mean, there's no one on this side who's gonna stop you.

184
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,900
I think if you guys have a list, you know,

185
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,740
put together whatever list and we'll find some,

186
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,860
I mean, there's so many people that come to Ireland

187
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,020
and then realize that they've got Irish heritage, right?

188
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,620
Like Obama was here a few years ago

189
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:20,180
and he's got a very strong, like Irish...

190
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,020
You can't have him.

191
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,140
I mean, there's so many, you go for it.

192
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,740
Okay, all right, you guys can keep him then.

193
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,620
Yeah, we need to keep him.

194
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,460
I know.

195
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,140
Wait, can we trade if you're getting Beyonce and stuff?

196
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:29,980
No. No?

197
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:30,820
Okay.

198
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,660
We can't trade?

199
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,480
Can't trade.

200
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,320
Depending on who you were, sorry,

201
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,820
depending on who you were gonna say, maybe, yeah.

202
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,700
It's gonna be all worked out.

203
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,220
Listen, Tom, you and I are gonna work this out.

204
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,620
We're gonna start an exchange,

205
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,580
but we're gonna make lists of people

206
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:45,340
that the Irish can claim

207
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,460
and then I think we should get to have Liam Neeson.

208
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,300
Yes.

209
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,120
You know, he's so cool.

210
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,700
I'm just curious, how many of you would we have to trade

211
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,100
to get one Liam Neeson?

212
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,180
You know what, I looked it up, 35 Conans.

213
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,020
Yes.

214
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,460
35 Conans gets you Liam Neeson's shoulder.

215
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,300
Worth it.

216
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,140
I'll take it.

217
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:01,980
Sold.

218
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,800
You don't think these celebrities would have a problem

219
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,640
with these festivals?

220
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,320
Do as they're told.

221
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,160
Okay.

222
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,720
I would love for you to say that to Beyonce.

223
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,840
Well, I'm not gonna say that to Beyonce,

224
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,080
but boy, I'm gonna say it to Liam Neeson.

225
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,920
I don't fear him at all.

226
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,760
Confusion.

227
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,720
Yeah, he's my height and looks like,

228
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,960
I talked to him not long ago

229
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,360
and it was so clear to me the minute he walked in the room,

230
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,560
like, oh, that's a real man.

231
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,880
I'm a Lucky Charms leprechaun.

232
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,760
Anyway, Tom, this sounds like a good endeavor.

233
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,800
I'm glad that you're working on building up,

234
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,840
reclaiming what rightfully belongs to Ireland.

235
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,240
I think that's important.

236
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,360
Yeah, I mean, we try to, you know,

237
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,560
there's only so much you can get out of Dracula, right?

238
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,200
In terms of a festival, like we need new ideas every year

239
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,480
and we try to present it in different ways.

240
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,560
So we have a lot of fun with it.

241
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,560
It's not just all, we don't just, you know,

242
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,660
we describe it as we're not just like, muahaha.

243
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,080
Like we try to have a lot of fun with it

244
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,280
and kind of bring- Although that sounds fun.

245
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,080
Yeah, that sounds really fun.

246
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,880
I would go to a muahaha fest.

247
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,400
Come to muahaha.

248
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,520
Well, also I'm not aware of what else did Bram Stoker,

249
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,200
I don't really know, other than, I know him for Dracula,

250
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,960
but did he write, you know, erotic fiction that I could read?

251
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:20,360
And if it's not erotic fiction, I don't want to read it.

252
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,960
The first book he ever wrote was actually a book,

253
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,720
like it was a guide for civil servants,

254
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,640
like people who were like, oh, I'm turned on.

255
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,880
So he did write some erotic fiction.

256
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:30,840
Exactly.

257
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,080
So depending on your case, I guess, that's a good one.

258
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,120
But none of his other work has really made it into the kind of consciousness

259
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,400
and the same way that Dracula has.

260
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,040
But I mean, you know, I don't think like being a one hit wonder for Dracula,

261
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,760
I feel like it's still a pretty good-

262
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,640
Oh, yeah.

263
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,320
Rear highlight. Yeah.

264
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,320
So we tried to kind of stretch out everything.

265
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,120
I mean, some of the stuff that I really enjoy,

266
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,680
like we've done a lot of research into Bram

267
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,000
and there's some great kind of lesser known things about him.

268
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,200
Like he once tried to save a man that was drowning in the Thames in London

269
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,000
because he didn't live in the UK for a while.

270
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,600
See, that's why they got to claim him.

271
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,520
That's the problem.

272
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,120
Yeah.

273
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:09,840
If you even, if an Irish person goes and lives in London for a week,

274
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,280
they get to put up a blue plaque somewhere and say, yep,

275
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,840
he's the UK's own Bram Stoker.

276
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,320
You know, it's just not fair.

277
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,200
Only if they're wildly successful though.

278
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,200
I mean, if they're, you know, as soon as something goes wrong,

279
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,800
then they're immediately Irish, according to the British again.

280
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,760
Oh, okay. All right.

281
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,000
They just, those plaques, by the way, are put up with Velcro.

282
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,240
They come off the minute you do something.

283
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,720
And everyone's getting canceled these days.

284
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,560
I think those plaques probably come off as quickly as they go on.

285
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,760
So I'm going to bring my own blue plaque the next time I go to London

286
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,240
and some super glue and just glue it onto a building.

287
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,080
That's good.

288
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,600
And say, you know, sir Conan O'Brien lived here

289
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,960
or stood here and chewed some bubble yum for 10 minutes.

290
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,640
You're giving yourself a knighthood.

291
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,480
Sure, why not?

292
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,320
Okay.

293
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,160
Yeah.

294
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,000
I want to go back to Ireland,

295
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,800
but you're going to have a knighthood from Britain?

296
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,640
Sure.

297
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,560
So what color plaque do they use in Ireland?

298
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,560
If I go to Ireland, I want to glue some plaques up.

299
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,840
I'm pretty sure we use blue plaques as well.

300
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,400
You use blue plaques too?

301
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,440
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

302
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,280
All right.

303
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,080
We'll find out because I want to find out

304
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,640
exactly what they look like.

305
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,880
Make this priority.

306
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,200
Excuse me, Toms.

307
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,480
Oh, Toms got such a busy schedule

308
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,680
working on the Bram Stoker Festival.

309
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,760
Yeah, you've got 11 months of downtime.

310
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,200
Yeah, yeah.

311
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,920
You know, how many plastic fangs can you buy?

312
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,280
Yeah, I've got some time to put in.

313
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,760
You've got a pretty easy move ahead.

314
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,360
I am a civil servant.

315
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,120
I'm here to clean up the bureaucracy.

316
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,720
You can do that.

317
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,720
You can do that.

318
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,120
["The Stoker Festival"]

319
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,720
Tom, I'm going to come to Dublin and glue some plaques up.

320
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,560
That's what I'm going to do.

321
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,560
I want some plaques up that say,

322
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,920
Conan stood here, Conan bought some stew here,

323
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,080
Conan was asked to leave this gap

324
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,200
for unfolding too many sweaters, but not buying one.

325
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,000
Things like that.

326
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,920
Well, and how's your life going, Tom?

327
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,400
How's everything in life?

328
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,440
Yeah, it's pretty good.

329
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,360
I mean, as you said, I've got a few easier months ahead

330
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,000
because we're just in planning now,

331
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,720
but outside of work, things are going.

332
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,720
Yeah, things are good.

333
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,160
I'm looking forward to Christmas.

334
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,160
You got your tree up.

335
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,160
Have you done your shopping?

336
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,200
Got my tree up here.

337
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,600
I just started doing some shopping yesterday.

338
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,080
Yeah, things are, yeah.

339
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,080
I would think that Dublin would be a wonderful Christmas town.

340
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,720
It would feel very Christmassy there.

341
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,920
Yeah, it does, but it has that horrible thing

342
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,200
of kind of in the winter time here

343
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,320
when it's freezing outside

344
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,280
and it's roasting inside every shop you go into.

345
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,160
So you kind of panic buy really quickly

346
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,400
everything that you don't need

347
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,040
for far more than you would typically spend

348
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,840
because you're too warm and it's all very stressful.

349
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,000
But yeah, I mean, it is, aside from that,

350
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,240
it's a really nice place to be,

351
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,600
although it's a very specific complaint.

352
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,880
Yeah, that's just, you have

353
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,280
such a specific complaint.

354
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,600
The temperature difference between the outdoors

355
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,480
and the shop itself is such that I buy more quickly.

356
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,920
I can't live anymore.

357
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,720
I must take my own life.

358
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,080
Tom, do you have a question for Conan at all?

359
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,800
Yeah, actually, I mean, so, you know,

360
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,040
we're in the stage now of kind of festival planning

361
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,480
where we're thinking of ideas for next year.

362
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,680
And I guess just, you know,

363
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,960
I run the festival with my friend Maria

364
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,560
and we're collaborators.

365
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,160
We collaborate with each other and with artists.

366
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,960
And we wondered whether you have ideas for events

367
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,400
that we could run at the festival next year,

368
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,360
or if you yourself would like to come to the festival

369
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,760
and put on a show.

370
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,840
Oh, wow.

371
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,400
Well, first of all, I always,

372
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,760
I take any excuse to, you know, get in front of a crowd.

373
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,240
I'm very sick that way.

374
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,600
So, you know, it all depends on-

375
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,800
It would almost guarantee you one of those plaques as well,

376
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,640
I could say.

377
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,960
I would like a special edition red plaque.

378
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,800
Listen, Tom.

379
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,640
Say no more.

380
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,400
No, Tom, I bring my own plaques.

381
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:59,520
I don't want anything factual on my plaques.

382
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,480
I want all kinds of crazy information.

383
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,680
So it all depends on the schedule,

384
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,840
but obviously I'd love to attend a Bram Stoker festival.

385
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,400
In terms of ideas for what works,

386
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,040
I think you have to embrace the Dracula of it all.

387
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,160
I think trying to downplay Dracula is a mistake.

388
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,720
You've got to lean into Dracula.

389
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:24,320
And that means contests, find the Dracula.

390
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,960
He's somewhere in Dublin.

391
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:30,600
And, you know, you have, I mean, don't you think?

392
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,520
Absolutely. Whatever.

393
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,360
Have some fun.

394
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,680
Yeah. And then, you know the way there's a,

395
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,360
we have here in the United States, a chili eating contest,

396
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,040
and we have hot dog eating contest.

397
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,200
How many hot dogs can people eat very quickly?

398
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,880
I think it would be, how much blood can you drink

399
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,240
from this carotid artery?

400
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,920
Who can drink it the fastest?

401
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,640
Obviously you don't drink it from a real person,

402
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,360
but you simulate a carotid artery.

403
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,440
And then you have a whole bunch of people

404
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,640
like in a pie eating contest and see who can down the most.

405
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,480
And it's not real blood.

406
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,000
There's like fake cadavers on a table.

407
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,400
Dummies, like crash test dummies.

408
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,800
And who can drink the most blood?

409
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,280
And it's one, two, three, go.

410
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,720
And you know, the blood can be,

411
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,640
I mean, I would prefer it if it was real human blood,

412
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,760
but I understand how that's going to turn some people off.

413
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,760
But we could come up with a caro syrup or something.

414
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,920
Actually a great idea.

415
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,760
I think it's a fantastic-

416
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,120
You have to, like a blood drinking contest

417
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,240
and also like intestines, but they're linked sausages

418
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,320
that you have to just keep eating like a hot dog contest.

419
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,240
Well, that's a werewolf.

420
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,080
What are you talking about?

421
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,040
Dracula, hold it.

422
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,880
Dracula doesn't eat your intestines.

423
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,720
You know what? You're right.

424
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,560
They don't eat it.

425
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,400
What are you talking about?

426
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,880
I love how you immediately got angry.

427
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,000
Like, what are you talking about?

428
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,720
And I said Dracula, and you went, oh, right.

429
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,440
No, he drinks your blood.

430
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,880
Is that a werewolf though?

431
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:45,040
Yeah, a werewolf will disembowels you, rips you up,

432
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,000
tosses your innards all around,

433
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,840
and then goes running over the hill going, ah, woo.

434
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,160
You're right, and I'd like to formally apologize.

435
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,200
To the Bram Stoker community.

436
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,760
To the Bram Stoker estate,

437
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,760
I'd like to have my plaques taken down.

438
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,600
I'm sorry.

439
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,960
Hey, is there a Bram Stoker estate,

440
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,440
meaning are there people that still profit

441
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,280
from Dracula movies and things like that?

442
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,560
There is, yeah, actually the Bram Stoker estate

443
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,640
kind of allow us to continue with the festival every year.

444
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,880
He has a great grand nephew called Dacre Stoker,

445
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,160
who comes to the festival quite often,

446
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,960
who's also an author and has actually written

447
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,600
extensively about Dracula,

448
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,200
but also wrote a prequel book to Dracula.

449
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,040
Can I ask you something?

450
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:21,880
Which is soon to be made into a film.

451
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,040
Does his great-grandson ever appear to be someone

452
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,560
who's lived for millennia?

453
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,920
You know, like is like hundreds of years old

454
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,440
and actually could be Bram Stoker,

455
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,680
and does he ever say, well, when I wrote Dracula,

456
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:36,240
er, er, I mean, when my great-great,

457
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,080
em, em, when my great-grandfather wrote it,

458
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,760
and then you realize that he is in fact Vlad Dracul.

459
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,840
He does have a very particular look,

460
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,160
so you might be onto something there.

461
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,200
I'm telling you, lean into Dracula,

462
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:53,600
because the civil service novel ain't going nowhere fast.

463
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,000
Melville wrote one of those, Bartleby the Scrivener,

464
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,440
and it didn't sell, and then he went back to the giant fish,

465
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,240
and again, he was in the money.

466
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,360
So you gotta lean into what works.

467
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,400
And I think if Bram were alive today,

468
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,000
he'd be writing all kinds of more Dracula.

469
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,880
You know, Dracula goes to Las Vegas,

470
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,800
he'd be doing rom-coms with Dracula,

471
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,920
Dracula has a Nancy Meyers kitchen.

472
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,320
You know, there'd be all kinds of,

473
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,360
Dracula would be in the Marvel universe.

474
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,200
Oh.

475
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,120
I mean, he would, he just would.

476
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,280
So, lean into it, I say.

477
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,880
Hey, speaking of eating people's intestines,

478
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,360
I hear you're quite a cook, is that right?

479
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,200
Good transition, by the way.

480
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,360
Yeah, thank you, thank you.

481
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,640
I was told to get that in.

482
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,280
Yes, you're a cook, is that right?

483
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,920
So I'm not, I mean, I'm not a professional cook,

484
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,880
but it is the thing that I love doing the most, yeah.

485
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,760
And as I've got, you know,

486
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,720
I enjoy cooking for like big groups of people,

487
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,600
but I actually just started seeing someone recently enough

488
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,680
who is also a really good cook.

489
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,360
And I think he is in fact, far better than I am.

490
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,520
Which is-

491
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,920
That threatens your identity, doesn't it?

492
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,440
Slightly, yeah.

493
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,240
Because you thought of yourself as the great cook,

494
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,600
and now this other person comes along

495
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,320
and he's the better cook.

496
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,040
Can I come to your house?

497
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,040
Can you cook for me?

498
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,080
Sure, yeah.

499
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:07,960
We can both cook for you,

500
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,760
and then maybe you could decide which one is better.

501
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,440
Okay, all right.

502
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,240
I don't know that you have the most refined palate.

503
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,680
I don't have any palate.

504
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,040
I have a terrible, you know, I'll eat anything.

505
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,640
Her meter is Burger King or not Burger King.

506
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,680
That's the only thing that she can determine.

507
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,280
I, well that's, and you know,

508
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,760
I think Ireland used to get a bad rap

509
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,960
for not having very good food.

510
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,520
And that may have been true for a long time,

511
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,040
but I feel like in the 1990s,

512
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,160
that reputation started to change greatly

513
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,720
because what I heard is that young, brilliant chefs

514
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,160
that couldn't get a job in London would go to Dublin,

515
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:49,640
and suddenly that became this center of great cuisine.

516
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,000
And I think that's emanated out now

517
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,440
that people in Ireland actually enjoy very good food.

518
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,360
Is that true?

519
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,200
Totally, yeah.

520
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,040
Ireland's a great place to eat.

521
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,600
I think even, you know, a few years ago,

522
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,680
it might have just been in Dublin,

523
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,560
but now across the country,

524
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,200
there's so many incredible places to eat.

525
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,760
And I think, yeah, we had a bad reputation for, you know,

526
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,360
like ham and cabbage is like what people think, you know,

527
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,360
is like, although ham and cabbage is a pretty good meal,

528
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,680
if you ask me, but it was kind of what people expected

529
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,280
Irish food to be, but now it's much broader than that.

530
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,440
Well, I think I grew up, my mother exclusively,

531
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,920
there was a lot of fried ham,

532
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,880
a lot of ham and then fried ham and potato,

533
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,360
and potato with fried ham and then fried ham with potato.

534
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,120
It was delicious, it was really good,

535
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,840
but it was a lot of that.

536
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:36,960
And I think that was handed down generationally

537
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,560
because when her people left Ireland, that's what it was.

538
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,720
And so even all those years later in the 1970s,

539
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:47,120
I'm eating a ton of fried ham

540
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,880
to the point where I think I died two years ago

541
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,720
with a massive heart attack.

542
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,560
You're Dracula.

543
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,720
I'm Dracula.

544
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,560
Hey, wait a minute, back me up on this, Tom.

545
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,920
In Stoker's Dracula, doesn't he also turn into a wolf,

546
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,440
a werewolf on the Demeter?

547
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,280
Have you read Dracula?

548
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,120
You're really cutting me out here.

549
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,160
Have you read Dracula?

550
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,680
I would love it, he's just going on and on about it.

551
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,640
We're reclaiming Bram Stoker.

552
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,160
I'm reclaiming Bram Stoker.

553
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,640
I just realized he's a wolf,

554
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,040
he could turn into a wolf, a bat, and a mist.

555
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,640
Are you gonna fight me on the,

556
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,960
everyone knows Dracula eats intestines?

557
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,360
Yeah, you really want the sausage thing to happen.

558
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,680
Cause that's just stupid.

559
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,720
If you won it all, it'd be on the weirdest technicality.

560
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,160
I'll take it, I'll take it.

561
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,040
We all know Dracula urinated places to mark them

562
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,760
and he was always chasing cats.

563
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,280
What are you talking about?

564
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,880
He could turn into a wolf.

565
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,920
Okay.

566
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,320
I'm sorry, it's true, right?

567
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,400
You can, yeah.

568
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,600
Okay, so.

569
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,440
Yeah, all right, so we'll have-

570
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,600
Syndicated in the most major way.

571
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,960
Yeah, all right, well Tom,

572
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,480
I guess that's another suggestion

573
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,760
for your Bram Stoker festival is-

574
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,600
Some werewolf events.

575
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,880
Well, not werewolf, Dracula turning into a dog.

576
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,000
It's not a werewolf.

577
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,840
Eating sausages.

578
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,680
It's a werewolf.

579
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,080
Yeah, he could also turn into the thing

580
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,240
from the Fantastic Four.

581
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,600
Okay, now you're just poking fun and that's ridiculous.

582
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,400
Well, I'm really happy with myself.

583
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,280
Tom, thank you.

584
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,320
Thank you for reaching out.

585
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,160
Thank you.

586
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,240
Speaking to us, I will take it to heart

587
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,560
this whole Bram Stoker controversy.

588
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:13,560
I will work in the fact that Bram Stoker is Irish

589
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,480
in every conversation that I can in the most awkward way.

590
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,320
And I will fight this-

591
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,520
Thank you, I'd really appreciate it.

592
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,240
All right, well, happy holidays.

593
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,080
Yeah, you too.

594
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:22,920
And thank you so much.

595
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,740
Take care.

596
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,580
Thank you guys, thanks very much.

597
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,400
Thank you. Bye-bye.

598
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,240
Bye-bye.
